      description: "Achieving better legal protections for animals has historically been an uphill battle, but in the past year there have been a number of promising victories for animals in NSW. This includes an increase in penalties for animal cruelty offences, the recognition of companion animals in updated domestic violence legislation, and a move away from blanket bans on keeping pets in strata by-laws. The commercial breeding or importation of dolphins and other marine mammals is also being phased out in NSW following recent legislative amendments, and the fight against puppy farmers has recently ramped up."

      description: "Scientists know that the trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in our guts play an important role in health, influencing our risk of developing obesity, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and a wide range of other conditions. But now a large new international study has found that the composition of these microorganisms, collectively known as our microbiomes, is largely shaped by what we eat. By analyzing the diets, health and microbiomes of more than a thousand people, researchers found that a diet rich in nutrient-dense, whole foods supported the growth of beneficial microbes that promoted good health. But eating a diet full of highly processed foods with added sugars, salt and other additives had the opposite effect, promoting gut microbes that were linked to worse cardiovascular and metabolic health."

      description: "The idea that athletes need to take care of their sleep, nutrition, and physical attributes to perform better on game night is more prevalent than ever before. More and more organizations in professional sports and development leagues are introducing departments that look at sports science and how it helps teams win championships and perform better on a nightly basis. Dr. Tom Hazell is an Associate Professor in Kinesiology and Physical Education at Wilfrid Laurier University and he said sports sciences is an amalgamation of different disciplines in science related to sport."

      description: "The Issue-based Coalition on Health and Well-being is a coordination mechanism focusing on the achievement of SDG 3 – to ensure  healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages – and of the  health-related targets present in other SDGs. Due to the strong interconnections between health and sustainable development, coordination and partnerships across sectors are crucial to ensure harmonized and effective efforts. Led by WHO/Europe, it  builds on other ongoing partnership initiatives, such as those on  migration and health and on environment and health. In March 2020, the WHO-UN-Red Cross COVID-19 Platform was embedded in the IBC-Health, to facilitate coordination at the regional level to enhance multi-stakeholder engagement at the country level, ensuring a multi-sectoral response to COVID-19."

      description: "In the past several years, we’ve seen an explosion of technology solutions in every field of business, from cloud storage and collaboration to marketing. As a result, the way we work itself has been transformed. According to the BLS, the average worker today is almost twice as productive as workers in 1987. Just about everything can be accomplished on a screen, whether a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone. Technology is changing the nature of work and the types of work we focus on faster than ever before."

      title: "Education",
      description: "The first thing that strikes in our minds when we think about education is gaining knowledge. Education is a tool which provides people with knowledge, skill, technique, information, enables them to know their rights and duties toward their family, society as well as the nation. It expands vision and outlook to see the world. It develops the capabilities to fight against injustice, violence, corruption and many other bad elements in the society. Education gives us knowledge of the world around us. It develops in us a perspective of looking at life. It is the most important element in the evolution of the nation. Without education, one will not explore new ideas. It means one will not able to develop the world because without ideas there is no creativity and without creativity, there is no development of the nation."

      description: "As a mom, I sometimes feel pressure to make my children’s childhood “magical.” I see friends and family planning great trips and outings for their kids, and I can’t help but think that I’m not doing enough for mine. With a hectic schedule and limited resources, it’s just not possible to execute every special adventure that comes to mind. One day, after a while, I realized — who cares? Maybe in some ways, I do. But you know who definitely doesn’t? My kids! What I came to realize is that those special things children really want are not fancy getaways, but their parents’ love and attention. It’s not some amazing destination they care about — it’s the time spent together. Every parent has the ability to give their children wonderful experiences. It doesn’t have to be expensive, and it doesn’t have to involve a lot of planning. And there are many reasons why your kids will love it. You can keep it simple, and even local, by heading outdoors."
